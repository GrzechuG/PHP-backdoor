# What does it do? How does it work?
The script can be used  to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the <i> "Backdoor.php" </i> PHP program.
To send and recieve commands use the <i> "shell.py" </i> script. 



# Possible issues
The PHP script uses the <i> "shell_exec" </i> funtion, which can be blocked on the victims' server so the program won't work.
